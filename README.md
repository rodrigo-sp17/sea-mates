## Motivation

It is very easy for offshore workers, seafarers, aircraft pilots, and many other people who work for days away
from home to lose touch with their family and friends. More often than not, many of these friends also work on similar
conditions, so it is usually very difficult to schedule events where people who matter to you will be available. With
time, this difficulty may bring people apart, as many can tell.

In the age of social networks, SeaMates is an app attempting to close this gap. By adding friends and registering your
shifts, you always know when your friends are around or not. Also, when planning for an event, it will show you everyone
who will be available, allowing you to choose a day when everybody can gather together and not be missed.
